	<h2>Tables</h2>
	<h4>... soon.</h4>

	<p>The next few modules focus on building tables in HTML. But, as I was learning <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> properties on its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table">MDN page</a> I really wanted to figure out how they made the code elements look the way they did, so spent a few minutes looking at the source for the web page until I figured (some of) it out. If you want to check out this little sidebar adventure I went on, go <a href="/HTML/Pages/notes3.1.html">here</a>.


		<h2>Okay, Tables. For real this time</h2>
