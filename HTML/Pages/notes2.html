	<h1>This is the biggest heading</h1>
	<!-- All header elements are "block level elements" -->
	<h2>This is the second biggest heading</h2>
	<!-- This means they all require one line -->
	<h6>This is the smallest heading</h6>
	<!-- elements that do not behave this way are called inline elements -->

	<p>This is a <strong>paragraph</strong>. Paragraphs, like headers, are <em>block level elemments</em>; meaning they all require one line. If you placed several headers or parapraphs elements on a single line in your text editor, they would all be rendered on separate lines when viewed via your browser. <em>Not all elements behave this way.</em> This paragraph also has exampled of <strong>bolded</strong> and <em>italicized</em> text, so you can add more expression to your writing.As it turns out, these are not block level elements; these are called <em>inline elements!</em></p>
	<!-- The < p > tag is also a block level element -->


	<h3>Now we are going to do lists!</h3>

	<p>This is an ordered list:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This is the first item on the list</li>
		<li>This is the second item</li>
		<li>You get the idea</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Now, let's do an undordered list!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This is the first item on the list</li>
		<li>And it goes on</li>
		<li>Ad infinitum</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Just like how you can have bold tags nested inside paragraphs, you can do the same thing in lists. In fact, you can also have lists nested inside other lists!</p>

	<p>Here's an example with all of these elements, and a practical use case:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The name of the first place finisher would go here</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Their country</strong></li>
				<li>Their age</li>
				<li><em>Something interesting about the contestant</em></li>
			</ul>
		<li>The name of the second place finisher would go here</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Their country</strong></li>
				<li>Their age</li>
				<li><em>Something interesting about the contestant</em></li>
			</ul>
		<li>The third place finisher is listed here</li>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Their country</strong></li>
				<li>Their age</li>
				<li><em>Something interesting about the contestant</em></li>
			</ul>
	</ol>

	<h3>Divs and Spans</h3>

	<p>Not super relevant yet, since we don't have any CSS elements to make things look pretty, but here there was a bit of time spent learning about <strong>containers</strong>. The < div > tag is a block level element, and the < span > is an inline element, but otherwise allow you to do the same thing, for instance change the color/font/size/background/etc of a particular element on the page wihtout having it apply everywhere.</p>

	<h3>Attributes</h3>

	<p>Next up is learning about atttributes, and the <em>key-value pairs</em> that are used to make them work.</p>

	<p>This allows us to quickly transistion into learning about self-closing tags, and how to input images on a webpage. To wit:</p>
	<img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/28/01/2CD582EF00000578-3251482-image-m-10_1443400211916.jpg">
	<p>eeeeyyyy!!!!</p>

	<p>Next up is how to make hyperlinks; like one that links to where I found that <strong>stellar</strong> image. Find it <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/28/01/2CD582EF00000578-3251482-image-m-10_1443400211916.jpg">here!</a></p>


	<p>If you can't tell, I have yet to learn how to make images appear at different (less obnoxious) sizes. Maybe next time.</p>

	<p>Anyways, let's <a href="/HTML/Pages/notes3.html">move on</a>.</p>
