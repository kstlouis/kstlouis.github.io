	<h2>Sidebar: code segments on web pages</h2>

	<h4>Problem:</h4>

	<p>Sometimes you want to actually type out some code and have it displayed on your page, say for explanatory or demo purposes, but make it look different, so the reader knows explicitly that this is a code segment.  </p>

	<p>In such a case, you likely will want to type out specific characters that HTML relies on to make code work. You can't use it without breaking anything.</p>

	<h4>Solution:</h4>

	<p>The <strong><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></strong> tag</strong> and <strong>HTML Entities</strong></p>

	<p>HTML Entities are specific characters that HTML relies on, like the "less than" (&lt;) and "greater than" (&gt;) symbols. The ampersand (&amp;) is another. These are called <strong>reserved characters</strong>. A list of them, and how to type them out properly, can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_entities.asp">here.</a></p>

	<p>The <strong><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></strong> tag, meanwhile, is a phrase tag that defines a piece of computer code, and will format it accordingly. You'll often use it in conjunction with reserved characters.</p>

	You can and often will it in conjuction with hyperlinks as well. For instance, if you wanted to learn more about specific things that we've previously covered, you can check out the MDN pages for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table"><code>&lt;table&gt;</code></a> by clicking on their respective (and now slightly nicer-looking) links. They still don't look <em>that</em> great, but CSS will likely help with that later down the road. 

	<p>Okay, let's head <a href="/HTML/Pages/notes3.html">back</a> to learn more about tables</p>
