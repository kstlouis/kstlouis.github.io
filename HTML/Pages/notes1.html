	<p>I found some research somewhere that you are more likely to learn things by teaching them to someone else than you are to just read and/or write about them. (If I ever find that again, I'll link to it). Assuming that isn't total garbage, I decided that while I was taking my web development bootcamp I would write out my notes as if I was demoing to someone else; taking the learn-by-doing approach a step further. </p>


	<p><em>In theory</em>, I'll actually retain more of what I'm learning this way. If you're really bored (and/or completely insane) you are welcome to follow along and see my "notes" get progressively better-looking as time goes on and I learn more things.</p>

	<p>With that said, let's get started. Here's a breakdown of everything, since I know how to do lists now:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="notes2.html">Headers, lists, links and images</a></li>
		<li><a href="notes3.html">Tables</a></li>
	</ol>
