	<p>I found some research somewhere that you are more likely to learn things by teaching them to someone else than you are to just read and/or write about them. (If I ever find that again, I'll link to it). Assuming that isn't total garbage, I decided that while I was taking my web development bootcamp I would write out my notes as if I was demoing to someone else, instead of just making bullet lists of things over and over. Hopefully, this way I'll actually retain more of what I'm learning. And (if you're really bored and/or completely insane) you could follow along and *hopefully* see my "notes" get progressively better as time goes on and I learn more and more things.</p>

	<p>So, if you have *absolutely nothing* better to do, continue on to the <a href="page2.html">next page.</a></p>

	<p>*But seriously, I'm sure you have better things to do.</p>
