<h1>Hello, World</h1>

<p>Welcome, I suppose, to my (very early-stage) web page.</p>

<p>Since I'm not going to be in school this semester, I decided to enroll in an online web development "bootcamp". I'll be implementing new things to this page as I learn them. Expect the layout of this page to change as I progress through my modules and learn new ways to make it better.</p>

<h4>Some of the things I'll be learning soon(ish):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>basic text formatting</li>
  <li>basic color</li>
  <li>figure out how lists and bullets work
  	<ul>*<em>update: hey, I figured out how lists and bullets work!</em></ul>
  </li>
  <li>some more sophisticated text formatting</li>
  <li>more advanced page layout options</li>
  <li>hyperlinks to some of the other things I do online</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots to come, so if you <em>really</em> have nothing better to do, keep checking in here to see my progress. At some point, this page will have a blog as well as a repository for some of my photography work (full disclosure: my blogging and photography skills are about as good as my webpage building skills. You've been warned). For now you'll have to settle for a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/kellanstlouis">follow me</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/kstlouis/kstlouis.github.io">GitHub</a> page, which is coincidentally where this page is hosted.</p>

<p>Since it's worthwhile for me to learn how to make my site have multiple pages, I'll post my "notes" of what I've learned on a few separate web links. If by chance you're <em>really</em> a sadist, you can follow my horrible, sporadic and poorly-organized ramblings on the specific things I'm learning, once I figure that out.</p>
