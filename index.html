<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>In the next while, I’ll post my thoughts on the recent Apple keynote, which saw the launch of the iPhone 8 , 8 Plus, and “X” models. So stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>Since I'm not going to be in school this semester, I decided to enroll in an online web development bootcamp, which focuses on the fundamentals of webpage and webapp design. I'll be implementing new things to this page as I learn them, so expect the layout of this page to change often as I progress through my modules.</p>
