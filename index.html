<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Since I'm not going to be in school this semester, I decided to enroll in an online web development bootcamp, which focuses on the fundamentals of webpage and webapp design. I'll be implementing new things to this page as I learn them, so expect the layout of this page to change often as I progress through my modules.</p>

<p>Some of the goals in the short term:</p>
<p>- add color, text formatting, and integrate hyperlinks to other pages</p>
<p>- figure out how lists and bullets actually work</p>

<p>After the Apple keynote this year, I wrote a short bit on my initial thoughts on the launch of the iPhone 8 , 8 Plus, and “X” models. No longer timely, but would make for appropriate subject matter for on of my first "blog" posts.</p>

<p>In short, lots to come, so keep checking in to see my progress!</p>
