## First impressions on the the iPhone 8 / X keynote

As might be expected, I kept up to date on all of the rumors and speculation in the weeks leading up to the launch. I read all of the pundit takes, analyzed the minute details of the (admittedly few) supply chain leaks, and listened to the thoughts and opinions of some of the more popular speculators and fanboys. I thought that I had a pretty good idea of what was coming and what the keynote was going to entail.

For the most part, I was right. Details like the number of phones to be released (three instead of the usual two), the pricing (a very expensive, out-of-most-people's-price-point device), and the capabilities and features of each device were pretty much exactly in line with my expectations.

I still came away feeling surprised.  
#### "Ten"  

I just have to get this out: I **_really_** didn't see that name coming.

I won't go into too much detail with my feelings on this, but John Gruber makes an excellent summary of the arguments for not using the X as "ten" [here][X Man]. It's excellent, so just go read that instead of me re-writing what he already covered so well.

So what's next? It's still early to be talking about the next iPhone already, but with 8 and "Ten" being released on the same day, and how weird that still feels to me, I can't help but wonder what the iPhone names will look like going forward.

1. It's very likely that we won't see an "iPhone 9". I can't see them releasing that after releasing the "iPhone X", that would just be weird.

2. I also don't think 8S (and 8S Plus) makes very much sense, given that 7S was skipped. Maybe, but I doubt it.

3. My guess is the next iPhone lineup uses an entirely different naming scheme. The X successor isn't going to be called "Ten-S"; I'll bet money on it. I also find it pretty unlikely it'll be called the iPhone 11. "iPhone X-II" or some equivalent also seems a bit odd. I have yet to come up with any name that has "Ten" in it that feels even close to right.  

I really think the best name for the OLED model would have been iPhone Pro. Again, Gruber does a great explainer for this on his podcast, which I definitely recommend you check out. For what it's worth, I don't think that option is completely off the table: it's definitely possible that the "iPhone X" name really was just for the ten-year anniversary, and some more formalized naming scheme will take it's place next year, that is in no way directly related to it.

At some point I think the iPhone is going to adopt a naming structure similar to the Mac line, and ditch numbers altogether. Maybe iPhone, iPhone Plus, and iPhone Pro; with generational numbers to tell each year apart.

Maybe 2017 was a bit of a "transition year" for iPhone where the naming scheme doesn't match the year before it (otherwise, the 8 would have been called the 7S), and won't match the year after it either (since we're unlikely to see a direct follow up to the "X", or "8" for the reaosns I stated above). It would be fitting for this year to be the year that Apple gets to break free from the old ways, and pay tribute to a decade of nigh-unbelievable success in the process.
